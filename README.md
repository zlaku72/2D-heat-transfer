# 2D-heat-transfer
This repo contains the solution of 2D heat transfer problem in a complex geometery. The geometry and boundary conditions of the problem are illustrated in the picture below. The governing equation of heat transfer is $\nabla.K(\nabla(T)$. Here, conductivity $K$ varies by the equation $K=e^(-T)$. The MRST(Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox) module is used to solve the problem. It requires a clear idea about **Automatic Differentiation** in MRST and also MRST knowledge of generating grid in a quick and efficient way.
